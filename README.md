[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OcyCt22I1Ha3fgLzGi0ZZy/Front-end-UI-Task?type=design&node-id=1-4&mode=design&t=ZzZ3vo84xwZ6uxJF-0)

### Functional requirements:
1. The user should only be able to enter digits.
2. Groups of 3 digits should be separated by spaces (“1442” → “1 442”).
3. Starting at a width of 72 px, the input should adapt to the size of the entered value.

### Design requirements:
1. Should match the provided [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OcyCt22I1Ha3fgLzGi0ZZy/Front-end-UI-Task?type=design&node-id=1-4&mode=design&t=ZzZ3vo84xwZ6uxJF-0).

### Code requirements:
1. The input component should be usable as-is in other parts of the project.
2. You can modify this project as you see fit to match a “production-ready” state. (optional)
3. You can use any library/component that you deem necessary and would use in a real application. (optional)
